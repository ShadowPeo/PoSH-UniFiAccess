This is a PowerShell module designed for interacting with the UniFi Access system, this is designed to provide a backend to other applications set on top of this and using PowerShell Universal in this environment it is designed for, whilst I am happy to try and make this as universal as possible, the priority is for compatibility in the PowerShell Universal Environment.

**NOTE:** 
In addition to the terms of the Mozilla licence as included in this repository, the Victorian Department of Education (or whatever moniker they go by this week), as in the government department, is strictly prohibited from using this code in any way, shape or form to assist in their implementation of any of their planned changes (SCL, SID, ETC. Basically anything that takes away autonomy from the individual schools) individual school based technicians (TSSP/Local Techs) are more than welcome to use them and implement or change them for their use, but the overall Government Department is not.
